# Today's Assignment

Read About the History of General Artificial Intelligence Research, the future of AGI, and modern AI safety concerns. Write down your thoughts in the form of two-three questions you would ask your classmates. Please review the following resources:

* [History of Artificial Intelligence](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/history-artificial-intelligence/)
  1. It offers a bit of an explanation to the roller coaster of AI research; we saturate the capabilities of AI to the level of our current computational power (computer storage and processing speed), and then wait for Moore’s Law to catch up again.
  2. Ironically, in the absence of government funding and public hype, AI thrived. During the 1990s and 2000s, many of the landmark goals of artificial intelligence had been achieved.
  3. We will need to have a serious conversation about machine policy and ethics (ironically both fundamentally human subjects), but for now, we’ll allow AI to steadily improve and run amok in society. Humans are the neurons in the perceptron.
